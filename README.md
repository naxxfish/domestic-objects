This is a *curated* collection of *high quality*, *3D printable* objects that are intended to be used *in the home*.  

In the course of daily life, there are a myriad of small items which a person might make use of.  A clothes clip for holding up laundry to dry, a door wedge to keep a door open, or a self adhesive hook on which to hang a dish cloth, a comb to straighten your air.  These kinds of items are often mass produced, from thermoplastics like ABS or polyethylene, by the thousand. Often, they'll be produced cheaply and with poor quality control - and sold cheap enough that you don't always feel bad about throwing them out when they inevitably break.  We know that this disposable attitude to these items leads to plastic pollution, and indeed waste.  

Rather than encouraging the manufacture and sale of thousands of pieces of low quality, single use disposable plastic objects, we could create only the objects we require as we need them from a generic stock material using 3D printers.

This collection aims to provide the means for a home hobbyist 3D printing user to easily produce a number of commonly used objects with any reasonably low cost FDM 3D printer available on the market today - e.g. the [Original Prusa Mini](https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-mini/).  

The objects contained in this repository must conform to three fundemental requirements:

1. The packages must be of high quality, and be easily printable.
2. The contents must have an open license to share.
3. The objects must improve the quality of life of people who use them.

Each object should meet the requirements set out in the [Object Requirements](/contributing/OBJECT-REQUIREMENTS.md) documentation. 

## Using the Collection

The objects in the collection are in the `objects` directory.  You can browse through them by their name, by folder. Each object will have a directory containing at minimum a `models` directory, containing the 3D models of the parts of the object to print.  It will also contain a `metadata` directory, containing a description of the object and the settings required to 3D print it. 

In this initial release, there are no additional tools to assist in locating and using the objects.  However, the intention is to build a static site generator which can take these files to browse and download the models.
