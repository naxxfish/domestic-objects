## Intended Audience and Writing Style

An important part of making the collection feel useful is for the langauge used to describe it be straightforward and easily understood by the intended audience.  

The intended audience has these characteristics:

* They have a requirement for an item in the collection;
* They own, or have access to, a 3D printer; and
* They are sufficiently proficient at operating a computer to navigate a website to find an object they wish to print.
* They are, or know someone who is, able to operate a slicer package to prepare an object to 3D print

We cannot make any further assumptions about the audience.  Their level of formal education may range from little to none to the highest levels of academia. They may be of any culture, religion or nationality.  They may have any level of physical or mental ability.
